This is an unofficial conference poster template for UVT (West University of Timi»ôoara).
It is loosely based on the official UVT [branding](https://dci.uvt.ro/identitate-vizuala).
However, the university does not offer an example of a conference poster, so this is
just inspired by the existing examples.

## How to use

Copy `beamerthemeuvtposter.sty`, `beamercolorthemeuvtposter.sty`, `template.tex`,
and the relevant logos from `assets/` to your working directory. Modify
`template.tex` as appropriate and build with `PDFLaTeX` (or `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX`
for the adventurous).

The package defines the following options used as `\usetheme[opts]{uvtposter}`.

| Option                            | Description                           |

| `nomyriadpro`                     | Do not load the *Myriad Pro* fonts (default loads if available) |
| `showframe`                       | Shows a frame around page elements (margins, etc.) |
| `layoutgrid`                      | Adds a debug grid to check alignment  |
| `size=aN`                         | Set the paper size                    |
| `orientation=name`                | Set the orientation to "landscape" or "portrait" |
| Other                             | Other options are passed to `beamerposter` |

The standard branding colors are given below.

| Color                             | RGB

The following helper macros are defined for some standard functionality.

| Macro                             | Description                           |
| :-                                | :-                                    |
| `\footercontent`                  | Text added to the footer (should be properly spaced) |
| `\heading`                        | A macro that adds a small heading inside blocks |
| `\separatorcolumn`                | Adds a standardized spacing between columns |
| `\headerlogoleft`                 | Left-hand side logo in the header     |
| `\headerlogoright`                | Right-hand side logo in the header    |

## Fonts

Note that, by default this uses the [Myriad Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/myriad)
font. This font is generally not available for free, but can be purchased from
Adobe or a [reseller](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/adobe/myriad-pro). The
OTF fonts can be directly loaded by the `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX` engines. To
get it working on `PDFLaTeX`, use the [FontPro](https://github.com/sebschub/FontPro)
distribution. If you cannot obtain the font (or the installation does not work
for some reason), it can be disabled with the `nomyriadpro` option. When the font
is not found, the class falls back to using `\usepackage{helvet}`, which loads a
Helvetica look-alike called Nimbus Sans L.

If you are using `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX`, there are many other nice fonts to
keep in mind that would work well. For example: Carlito (a Calibri clone),
Caladea (a Cambria clone), Montserrat (inspired by Gotham), Adobe Source Sans,
and many others. A nice font will always make your poster look nicer!

## Acknowledgement

This theme is based on the [Gemini](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini/)
theme, but mainly keeps the header and footer from it. If you need a more general
theme, Gemini is quite wonderful!
